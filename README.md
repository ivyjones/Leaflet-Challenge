# Leaflet Challenge: Create Earthquake Visualization

Steps:
1. Get the data from USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
2. Import data
3. Visualize data using leaflet


Map should:
- have data about earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
- Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
